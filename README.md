wadl-express
============

Transform WADL descriptions to live RESTful web APIs.

   * Parses WADL description files into an intermediary JSON format. 
   * Creates express/connect 'pre-condition middleware' functions for each resource path, i.e. automatically creates a RESTful api with semantics as defined in the WADL file. 
   * Does scaffoling for REST API modules.
   * Almost complete support of the WADL specification.
